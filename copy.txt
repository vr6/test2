Nexus usecase

After I noticed in yesterday's FRD review call, that we don't have a requirement to maintain a list of supported platforms (DLT/HSM) and don't check a registration request against such list, I think we might be missing some other very basic stuff as well, which we can't detect now due to lack of a canonical/prototypical usecase. For example, defining the full on-boarding process is one more such area where we might need some user-experience (not UI) requirements.

I suggest that we identify an existing Citi app (Trade Bridge?) and think in terms of how that app might integrate with Nexus and what pain-points could be addressed. We might actually need that app (sand-boxed) in our environment.

Not sure if this makes sense becuase this could have aleady been addressed in some form, but this is only a suggestion just in case if it helps.
