* It provides an alternative CMP request form to get certficates.

* The SMG CMP process delivers the certificate files directly to the Nexus application as files.

* This is in contrast to the regular CMP process (non-SMG) which delivers files to the requestor or VM. The files need to be pushed to the application thorugh the deployment bundle.

* The deploymnet push could be avoided in the regular CMP case as well, if the certificate content is updated to the Nexus on-boarding data, which already has placeholders for this.

So I think it boils down to whether it is a Citi policy to use SMG for requesting certs for an application.

Also, we are deferring SMG integration until we get to UAT phase where we can use the certificates without manual manipulation of roots in the trust stores. This would not affect testing of Nexus functionality.
