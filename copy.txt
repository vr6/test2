Subodh,
I think we need some basic information, with regards to this task.

Task
* Is this task meant for creating a technical approach for a Corda app or is it for Nexus?

Specification document (from requirements team)
* Is this interface specification meant for a Corda app or is it for Nexus?
* If it is only meant for Nexus, are we free to choose approach for Corda app? (Token SDK etc)
* If it is meant for Corda app, then what interface specification for Nexus are we supporting?

Corda app for testing only?
* Are we developing the corda app as a dummy app so that we can test Nexus against it?
* If it is not a dummy app for testing, does it mean Nexus would always be bundled with this Corda app, and every Citi app will deploy this app on Corda network, for all usecases using Nexus?
* If it is a dummy app for testing, does it mean Nexus expects all Corda apps to support this interface (wherever Nexus is used)?

Archietcture diagram
* Currently Nexus architecture doesn't have this Corda app as part of Nexus. Can we have a high-level architecture diagram clarifying the above?

Thanks,
Venkat
