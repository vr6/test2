Hi Subodh,

You might remember that as I reported in the architecture call yesterday, this lib is a very old one (June 2007), and even some of its higher versions are prohibited or classified as vulnerable in Citi.

I think we need to review the whole point of SMG integration. If we have to store the certs and private keys os disk files (temp folder), then I don't see the point in using SMG. Using files is our current approach anyway, without SMG also.

We are not getting enough suport from SMG team. We do not know if someone is using SMG in Citi, why they use it and how they use it. The API reference docs are not available. API calls result in file creation instead of returning objects, which is a bit wierd for our usecase.

I suggest we park this SMG integration for MVP and revisit this when we have more information from SMG team.

If we do need to do this now, the we may need to raise a CTC request for this older version of crypto library and then the team can proceed. 

Thanks,
Venkat
