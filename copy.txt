Just curious - do we know of any current usage of AI in Citi in the areas of credit-risk rating etc?

Authorities will mandate validation/certification of fin services using approved test frameworks (open-source). If we already have services employing AI in the designated areas, the services will need to be re-validated. Fresh implementations will typically embed these tools in their test harnesses.

The opensource mentioned sounds similar to the TCK (Technology Compatibility Kit, provided by Sun Microsystems) which I used to run for certifying J2EE/SOAP platforms against the standardized specs. Its a test suite with 100's of test cases. When I submit the all-green test results to authorities, my web-services platform gets certified.
