Nice find, Adrian. Thanks for sharing!

Though technically not as ground breaking as Deep Blue (1996) or AlphaGo (2015) in human-machine interaction, I think this development is in a very critical direction.

While technologoy services/products are rapidly expanding to reach every human on the planet, customer services are failing due to capacity constraints. However this problem pertains to only the edges of technology adaption, because once the adaption is complete, the interaction moves from voice to APIs or gestures.

Thanks,
Venkat
