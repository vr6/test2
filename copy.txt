Sorry Prag,

I didn't thnk there is no "mis-alignment" at all in this conversation. I think the two emails on which I copied infosys team are normal work-related communications only, which, I thought, requires dev team to be in loop.

I'm the one who does the tech reviews with dev team for the stories that are ready. But we normally don't do take up research tasks for this review. Subodh knows this and I reminded the same to him in the first email (no mis-alignment).

Thanks,
Venkat
