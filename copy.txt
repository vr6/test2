Further, I want to note that the database update requirement for modifying a Nexus subscription record is currently a bit too complex or non-standard, I think. I suggest we revisit this requirement after the current release.

Mongodb document update is quite common, and I don't think our subscription record is special in structure or in requirement. We may be able to just follow the standard practices.

When a mongodb document (record) has an array of child objects in it, and if one or more of the array elements need to be modified, the standard practice is to provide the IDs for the array elements to be modified (to locate them) and specify new values (key-value pairs). The fields to be updated should not be ID fields. If you want to change ID, first delete the object and insert a new object.

The above should suffice all reasonable update requirements. Essentially, the request for update should mostly resemble the request for creation of a new document, in structure.
