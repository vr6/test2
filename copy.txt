Hey Matt,

Thanks for letting me know. I guess we both can talk any time to see where things are going in this area. Also, I think there will be more talks from me. Becuase I see a huge up-tick in activity recently in the area of Quantum unitary matrices for Deep Learning.

People say that machine learning has reached its limits due to breakdown of Moore's law, and only quantum computing can help progress it from here on.

Thanks,
Venkat
