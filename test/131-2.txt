Dear Sir/Madam,

I am an NRI employed and living in Ireland. Kindly refer to copies of my passport and my Irish Residency as proof of my NR status.

My association with KBC Bank is limited to having a current account for receiving my salary income from my employer in Ireland and a second current account for my expenses. I do not have any financial interest, investment or other income with KBC Bank.

I did not make any acquisition of any foreign asset and do not have any owner/beneficial/settler relationship with any bank located outside India.

All my income in Ireland is fully tax-paid in Ireland (proofs are attached). I did not transfer any money from Ireland to India any time.

I did not specify my Ireland salary income in my India income tax returns as I was non-resident for the assessment years. Kindly let me know if I can re-submit my tax returns to reflect my NR status.

Kindly refer to Summary-proofs.pdf for a summary of the proofs.

Many thanks and have a good day!
Thank you
